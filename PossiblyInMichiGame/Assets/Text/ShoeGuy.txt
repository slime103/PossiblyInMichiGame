Oh frick frick frack, oh jeez...~I have an interview at this gosh dang pet store today,~But I lost my other shoe!~I look like a complete fool, they’ll never hire me with just one shoe!
What’ll I do, what’ll I do?!~Frick frick FRACK!
Money?~Do you think that would make me seem classy?~Maybe, but no one’s gonna hire a guy with only one shoe, even if he does have a quarter!~Frick frick FRACK!
