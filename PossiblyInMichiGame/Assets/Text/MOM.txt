MOM
Y’know, his father is to blame for this! Probably…, I swear this happens everytime I take him outside!, Aww now who am i gonna cook brusselsprout cookies for?
You found him! Why?
You’re so silly, my son is so much more triangular than this., Hmm it could just be my eyes but I'm 50% sure this isn't my baby.
Oh, you! I couldn’t possibly take this! I mean it! Get that away from me!
Oh my gawd, have you seen my bahbee? He’s about this small and tastes like a pumpkin. Oh I could just EAT HIM UP!, Ohhhh now I'm going to be late to get his sister from the grocery store. She's only a week old.
Oooooh look at that face he’s sooooo cute., Hey! If you keep eating all that junk you’ll never be smart!
