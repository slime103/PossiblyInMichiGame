MOM
Y’know, his father is to blame for this! Probably…, I came here to buy some new heels but they’re so ugly. They don’t even have cup holders! What sort sham are they running here?
You found him! Thank you sooooo much. Me and this little meatball are so grateful! Isn’t that right sweetie?
You’re so silly, my son is so much more triangular than this.
Oh, you! I couldn’t possibly take this! I mean it! Get that away from me!
OH my gawd, have you seen my bahbee? He’s about this small and looks like a pumpkin. Oh I could just EAT HIM UP!, Ughhh, I still need to do my hair, my nails, my face, my feet, my legs, and my armpits after this.
Oooooh, look at that face, he’s sooooo cute., Hey! If you keep eating all that junk, you’ll never be smart!
