MOM
Hello there, hello there!~Do you work at the store?~No matter, I’m looking for a baby.~Not just a regular baby, like these ones.~These babies are far too weak.~I require only the strongest of babykind.~Please find one for me.
Please find me a powerful baby, packed with dark magic.~Um, forget that dark magic part.
I can only buy a low-power baby with this chump change, get it away from me!~A baby that meets my specifications would cost at least five human souls.
YOU SHOULDN’T BE SEEING THIS
Is this a joke?~Be careful, or you’ll incur my wrath.
Perfect!~This baby’s power level is off the charts!~It will surely fuel my foul contraption and allow me to commune with the dark gods!~Well, now I have other ways of hearing the music of the void,~So I no longer need this ear I took from the Carpet Muncher. Here you go!
YOU SHOULDN’T BE SEEING THIS
YOU SHOULDN’T BE SEEING THIS
YOU SHOULDN’T BE SEEING THIS
I can finally take my vengeance!~The world shall know my power!
YOU SHOULDN’T BE SEEING THIS
YOU SHOULDN’T BE SEEING THIS
YOU SHOULDN’T BE SEEING THIS
YOU SHOULDN’T BE SEEING THIS
I told you I don’t need this anymore.~You should really return this to the Carpet Muncher.
I am not concerned with footwork, now that I have unlocked the ultimate power: motherhood.
Oh my...~This being...~Perhaps its power equals, or even exceeds my own, even with the aid of this baby!
