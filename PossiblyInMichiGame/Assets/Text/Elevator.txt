THE ELEVATOR
Well hey there!~I’m The Elevator, and I get to decide who goes up and who goes down.~I don’t think I’ve seen you before...~So I’m not sure if you’re the kind of person who belongs on the upper level...~Maybe if you gave me a sweet, key-shaped snack, I might change my mind...?
Listen, you seem cool, but I really can’t take you up to the upper level!~(Unless you give me a tasty snack!)
You can’t bribe your way to the upper floor!~Well at least, not with money.~You can absolutely bribe your way to the upper floor with a delicious key.
Scrumptious!~Now that you have proven yourself a true person of class, I feel comfortable allowing you to the upper level.
Hmmm, this isn’t quite what I’m into, sorry.~I prefer something more metallic, and, hmm, key-shaped.
YOU SHOULDN’T BE SEEING THIS
YOU SHOULDN’T BE SEEING THIS
YOU SHOULDN’T BE SEEING THIS
YOU SHOULDN’T BE SEEING THIS
If you want to go to the other floor, go ahead and push that pretty little arrow next to me!
I don’t really need any change, dude, but thank you!
YOU SHOULDN’T BE SEEING THIS
Yuck!~If my elevator oath to allow you to travel freely between floors wasn’t bound by eldritch magics,~I would revoke your elevator privileges right now!
I can’t eat this, it was already in that weird lake guy’s mouth! Grody!
I don’t actually need ears, I can read your mind!~By the way, did you get that from that weird lady in the Realm of Bargains?~I wonder why she had that ear anyway...
Do I look like I have feet?
Wow, that’s a healthy looking snail!~Hello little snail, do you have any keys for me?
