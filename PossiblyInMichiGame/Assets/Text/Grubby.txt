GRUBBY KID
Hey! Hey you!, I know you can hear me!, Psst!
You got a quarter?, My dad left me here. That was 3 weeks ago., If I get gum he'll come back.  
Useless. Gimme a quarter., You know how gum machines work?, I've been eating dust and paper for 3 weeks. I need gum., Dad will come back soon…
Do you want thanks? You're not my dad. Leave me ‘lone. 
You broke or something? I just want a quarter., Come on you gotta have something...
Yes! I knew you had money. [chews the gum] I’m done. Here. [spits it at player’s hand]
