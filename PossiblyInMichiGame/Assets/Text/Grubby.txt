GRUBBY KID
Please, please help me!~I need, and I mean NEED, one of these sweet delicious gumballs.~My entire being aches to chomp on that colorful, chewy stuff.~Alas, I am barred from my prize by this wretched machine!~It asks of me that which I do not have: a single quarter!
I must have my gum orb!~My chewy sphere!~My sugar globe!
This is it! This is what I need!~Alright, now let me just insert it into this contraption...~Ah! At last! My gumball!~...~...~...~This is the foulest thing I’ve ever tasted.~You take it.
Ah, if only it were so easy! This key doesn’t fit into the coin slot of this machine!
YOU SHOULDN’T BE SEEING THIS
YOU SHOULDN’T BE SEEING THIS
YOU SHOULDN’T BE SEEING THIS
YOU SHOULDN’T BE SEEING THIS
YOU SHOULDN’T BE SEEING THIS
This is the most upset I have ever been.~My disappointment is immeasurable, and my day is ruined.
YOU SHOULDN’T BE SEEING THIS
Ah, I know that some people enjoy the taste of these keys, but my tiny child teeth cannot properly chew them.~Alas, if only I was part machine.
Never show me that hideous glob of lies!~Get that disgusting thing away from me, it has ruined my life!
It reminds me of my youth, ~Before my naive view of the world was corrupted by that foul gumball.
Why on earth do you have an ear?
Am I supposed to eat that?
Even this incredible snail cannot lift my spirits after this most ultimate betrayal.
