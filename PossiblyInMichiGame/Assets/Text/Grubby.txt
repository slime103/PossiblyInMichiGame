You got a quarter?, Yeah. Gimme some money I want that gum. 
Useless. Gimme a quarter., You know how gum machines work?, You know what I want., Someone will give me money soon…
Do you want thanks? Leave me ‘lone. 
You broke or something? I just want a quarter., Come on you gotta have something...
If you don’t have any more money, go away!
