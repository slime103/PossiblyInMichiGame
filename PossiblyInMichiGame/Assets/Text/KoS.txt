KEEPER OF SCENTS
Yes, yes, step closer…~You’ve come because of the flyer, yes?~You desire my most aromatic concoction, don’t deny it. I can see it in your eyes.~This perfume is my most precious possession,~And I will only give it to you when you have retrieved for me that which I most desire:~The most valiant of steeds, the giant African land snail.~Now go, take this key and find me a snail!
What is your progress on your quest for the snail?~If you do not have it, then you cannot have my artisanal stink-juice!
Oh, how quaint. You wish to pay with mortal money.~I bow not to gold or silver,~The only currency I accept is in the form of beautiful snails, particularly those that dwell upon the land!
If I wanted that key I could have picked it up myself.~I don’t like the way they taste, but I know many consider keys to be a delicacy.
This is no snail!~Do you wish to fool me?~I admit they are both sticky and slimy, but this is clearly some sort of… brain?~Oh no, it’s just gum.~I still don’t want it.
I literally have no idea what this is.
Oh my, I don’t need this but I’m sure someone does!~Venture throughout the store to find someone missing an ear, I’m sure they will reward you heartily.
Did you really think that would fit me?~How would I even put it on?~Seriously, you need to be much more considerate.~Plus, what am I going to do with only one shoe?~It would be best with its twin.
...~...~...~...~...my goodness.~It’s so much more beautiful than I could have ever imagined!~Here, take your perfume, I have no need for it anymore.~In fact, hop on the back of this African land snail and we’ll ride it all the way...~To the  N O S E  V O I D!
