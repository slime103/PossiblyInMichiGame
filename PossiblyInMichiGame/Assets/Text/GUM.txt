THE GUM LAD
I do not remember how I got here.~All I know is that…~I am the Gum Lad.~And I require gum.
Are you gum?~If you’re gum you legally have to tell me or else it’s entrapment.~Well, if you find any gum, let me know and I’ll let you into The Mouth Zone.
There is no way this is gum.~Right?~I mean I’m the Gum Lad.~I should know whether or not it’s gum.
YOU SHOULDN’T BE SEEING THIS
This isn’t gum.~It is?~I thought it would look more appealing...~Well, I am the Gum Lad, I suppose this is my destiny.~Oh my goodness, that’s absolutely foul.~It is kinda tasty though...~Hm, alrighty, you can go ahead and click on that red arrow on the mountain to go to the mouth zone.
YOU SHOULDN’T BE SEEING THIS
YOU SHOULDN’T BE SEEING THIS
YOU SHOULDN’T BE SEEING THIS
YOU SHOULDN’T BE SEEING THIS
I suppose one day I’ll learn to truly be the Gum Lad.~I will make this stock image my home.~Maybe one day you will be the Gum Lad, too.
YOU SHOULDN’T BE SEEING THIS
YOU SHOULDN’T BE SEEING THIS

This baby was in The Mouth Zone?~Peculiar...~Ah, I see...~This child has great darkness within its heart.
I won’t ask any questions about how you got that ear.
Before I can even think about fashion, I need to learn how to be a proper Gum Lad.
Wait, this is the creature that banished me to this realm!~You have to get rid of it as soon as possible!
