CARPET MUNCHER
I do hope this is organic., Did you know carpets are high in fiber?, Before this I ate mattress foam. It was too chewy.*
Hmmm? Might those be my missing ears? Oh you’ve just made my day friend! I am indebted to you!
I’ve everything I need right hear. I need for nothing else!, My diet consits of more than just carpets. I also eat lamps.
I apologize but this really isn’t the time to be joking. Now if you’ll excuse me I’ve more carpets to eat., Well clearly you must have lost your ears as well. This is not what I need.
Oh how nice it is to be able to hear again! I’m incredibly happy!
Hello there sir. I’m terribly sorry but as currently do not possess my ears, I am unable to hear you., I might eat capret but at least I'm not a vegan.
