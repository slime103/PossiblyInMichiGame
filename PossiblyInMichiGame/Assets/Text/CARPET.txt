more eating NOISES*, I do hope I’m able to find my ears soon., Don’t be suspicious, don’t beeee suspicious*
Hmmm? Might those be my missing ears? Oh you’ve just made my day, friend! I am indebted to you!
I’ve everything I need right hear. I need for nothing else!
I apologize, but this really isn’t the time to be joking. Now if you’ll excuse me, I’ve more carpets to eat., Well clearly you must have lost your ears as well. This is not what I need.
Ah, how nice it is to be able to hear again! I’m incredibly happy!
*Various chewing noises. They sound like a mix of chewy and crunchy, like metal as well, Hello there, sir. I’m terribly sorry, but as currently do not possess my ears, I am unable to hear you.
