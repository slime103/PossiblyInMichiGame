CARPET MUNCHER
MmmmmmmmmmmmmMmMmMMMMMmMMMMMm~This is the most~Delicious~Scrumptious~And refined carpet I’ve ever tasted.~Truly a dream!~It’s the only thing I can do to cope with the loss of my ears.~In fact, if anyone desires anything from me, I surely wouldn’t be able to respond until I got my ear back.
Hnnngggghhh what incredible carpet this is!
A quarter? Now why would you give me a quarter?~I have no need for money, I have all I’ll ever need here:~Carpet, carpet, and more carpet!~(Although I suppose I would really like my ear...)
YOU SHOULDN’T BE SEEING THIS
No! Don’t bring that chewed gum any closer to my precious carpets!~It’ll get all stuck and ruin them!~There should be a lad by the stock image of a lake that desires gum, bring it to him instead!
A baby?~No thanks!~What if it wants to eat my carpets? What a nightmare!
Oh my goodness! Thank you!~I can finally hear again!~What’s that?~You need my shoe?~Go ahead and take it! I don’t remember where I got it, anyway!
YOU SHOULDN’T BE SEEING THIS
YOU SHOULDN’T BE SEEING THIS
These carpets taste even better when I can hear the satisfying crunch!
YOU SHOULDN’T BE SEEING THIS
YOU SHOULDN’T BE SEEING THIS
YOU SHOULDN’T BE SEEING THIS
YOU SHOULDN’T BE SEEING THIS
YOU SHOULDN’T BE SEEING THIS
No no, I don’t need that shoe, you can have it!
Oh wow, a new friend!
